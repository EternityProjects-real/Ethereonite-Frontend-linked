# Ethereonite

Bringing block chain to everyone

## Social Problem

Ever since the COVID-19 Pandemic happened, the Global economics have been suffering.  Alot of people lost their job and businesses. Moreover,  ever since the 2007-08 economic crisis the banking system had never fully recovered and their policies have gone stale over the past decade. Unable to accomidate the needs of the people.

## Our Idea


1. A web portal where you can make crypto transactions          
2. The payment is universal and on the blockcahin. 
3. Crowd sourcing where people  can contribute and pay in crypto
4. A fundraiser which will donate money towards covid help.
5. We will liquedate the crypto which can straight up generate cash and help the families in need.


## Project Scope
### User-Friendly
We will have a very minimalist easy to use ui which will make the transactions like a breeze and without any problem.
### Revolutionize
This will make the whole concept of using crypto and blockchain easy to use for new-comers and veterans alike and improve the banking sector as a whole.
